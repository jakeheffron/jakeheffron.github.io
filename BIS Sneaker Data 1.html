This summer, our team has been working on a model to help predict the prices of highly sought-after sneakers. Jake Heffron, Jake Hennes, Kailey Hetler, and Truett Pittman, have utilized several R packages to analyze Tweets leading up to a new sneaker's release to gain understanding of the public's anticipation for the launch. This website explains how the team gathered, compiled, and analyzed the data to prove the hypothesis.

In theory, the relationship between tweet sentiment and the launch markup from suggested retail price will allow the team to predict a sneaker's selling price before its launch.

Initially, the team set out to gather thousands of tweets to analyze. Using the rtweet package and a custom twitter developer app, the team pulled tweets from the days leading up to seven individual sneaker launches. The following shoes were analyzed:

- Nike Air Max Green
- Nike Air Max Orange
- Grateful Dead Dunk
- Jordan University Gold
- Off White Jordan Sail
- Yeezy Blue Oat
- Jordan XI Low Concord

For each sneaker, a table 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
